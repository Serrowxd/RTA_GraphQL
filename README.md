# RTA_GraphQL

This is a mastery point for GraphQL.

Front-End built with a simple React template, Back-End is NodeJS and Apollo GraphQL.

The plan is to have a simple data randomizer, a heartbeat, then create a subscription to the front-end.

This is my way of mastering a concept that I don't fully understand.
